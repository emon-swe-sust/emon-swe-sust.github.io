      "Hello, I am a Lecturer in the Institute of Information and Communication Technology at Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST), Sylhet, since November 2023. I teach a range of foundational and advanced courses including Software Verification and Validation, Software Architecture and Design Pattern, Data Structures, Algorithm Design and Analysis, Competitive Programming, and Introduction to Software Engineering. I also mentor undergraduate students in their thesis and research projects.",
      "Before joining SUST, I worked as a Software Engineer at Dynamic Solution Innovators (DSi) for over two and a half years. During that time, I was involved in impactful projects such as OpenCRVS (a civil registration platform) and InfoReach (a banking solution). I continue to collaborate with DSi as a consultant alongside my academic responsibilities.",
      "My current research focuses on the intersection of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence, particularly enhancing software reliability, program analysis, optimizing software maintenance, automating software engineering processes, such as finding and fixing bugs, generating test cases, and building smarter developer tools. I am currently leading two research projects in this area in collaboration with undergraduate students. I aim to pursue a Ph.D. in Software Engineering, with a focus on intelligent systems and AI-assisted software development tools, to contribute further to the field through research and innovation.  "
